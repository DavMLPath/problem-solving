# it chooses input fields randomly, first offers user to fill word based on its type, then in the end shows the taxt.

#this function takes 3 inputs: a , b, t . a is the list of all individual parts of texts seperated withn {}, as described in previews code. b is the list of input variables. t is the text with missing input fields.
# The steps in code are the following: 
#1) creates list of all individual parts of texts seperated withn {} (list a)
#2) take the random var from list b and get it's index. then take element of list a with the same index and using .format, fill {} with input word.
#3)repeat it until all items are replaced in list a 
#4) join all items in filled list, after all indexes are replaced
